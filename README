Simon Says Game in Scratch

Overview

Welcome to the Simon Says game built in Scratch! This is a fun and interactive game where a Game Master gives commands, and the player must follow them—but only if “Simon says” to do so! If the player clicks on the wrong ball or follows a command without “Simon says,” they lose the game.

Features

	•	Three balls: Ball, Baseball, and Basketball.
	•	Game Master: Gives random commands for players to follow.
	•	Simon says logic: Only follow commands that start with “Simon says.”
	•	Score tracking: Track the player’s correct responses.
	•	Randomized gameplay: The commands and balls are randomized to keep things interesting.

How to Play

	1.	Click the Green Flag to start the game.
	2.	The Game Master will give a command, such as “Simon says click the basketball.”
	3.	If “Simon says,” follow the command by clicking on the correct ball.
	4.	If “Simon” doesn’t say, do not click on any ball.
	5.	The game will continue to issue commands, and you must click only when appropriate.
	6.	If you follow a command correctly, your score increases. If you follow a wrong command or click when “Simon didn’t say,” the game will end.

Game Components

Sprites

	•	Game Master: The character that gives the commands.
	•	Ball: A simple ball sprite.
	•	Baseball: A baseball sprite.
	•	Basketball: A basketball sprite.

Variables

	•	SimonCommand: Stores the current ball type that Simon says to click.
	•	IsSimonSays: Stores whether the current command starts with “Simon says.”
	•	Score: Tracks how many correct commands the player has followed.

Project Structure

Game Master Logic

The Game Master randomly selects between:

	•	“Simon says click the ball,” or
	•	“Click the basketball” (without Simon saying).

The commands are randomized using the pick random block, and players must determine if they should follow the command or not.

Ball Sprites

Each ball sprite (ball, baseball, and basketball) listens for mouse clicks:

	•	If the clicked ball matches the SimonCommand and “Simon says,” the player gains a point.
	•	If the player clicks incorrectly or clicks when “Simon” didn’t say, the game ends.

How the Game is Coded

	•	Random Ball Command: The Game Master uses pick random (1) to (3) to choose between the ball, baseball, and basketball.
	•	Simon Says Logic: A random number determines whether “Simon says” is included in the command.
	•	Player Input: Players must click the correct ball based on the command.
	•	Game Over: If the player clicks the wrong ball or follows a command without “Simon says,” the game will stop.

How to Customize

	•	You can add additional commands or even more ball types by expanding the Game Master’s command list and adding new sprites.
	•	Add sound effects or animations to enhance the gameplay experience.
	•	Implement difficulty levels by decreasing the time between commands as the game progresses.

	•	Scratch: The game is built entirely using the Scratch programming platform.
